# Hi there!

This is Jasmine. I am doing my last year master study in Usyd.

I went to Sydney since I was 15, but it was hard for me to find any pic from that year (yup, I was too shy to take photos)

- This was me in yr 12 grad ball:

- This was me in Christmas Eve this year:

- I love to play tennis, though I am just new to tennis.

Wish you guys all the best! 

AND... 
## HAPPY LUNAR NEW YEAR!!!
